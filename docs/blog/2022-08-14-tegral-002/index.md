## OpenAPI support

As I mentioned in the [first blog post](../2022-06-02-tegral-001/index.md#whats-next), one of the next steps for me would be to migrate some other libraries I've made in the past to the Tegral framework. This was done with the migration of [Koa](https://github.com/utybo/Koa), a set of OpenAPI libraries. Koa was significantly improved (practically rewriting it) and has now become **Tegral OpenAPI**. This initial release includes:

- [DSL support](pathname:////docs/modules/core/openapi/dsl)
- [Scripting](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/scripting)
- [Ktor support](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/ktor)
- [Tegral Web support](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/tegral-web)

### Authoring Tegral OpenAPI scripts

Here's an example of what documenting your API using OpenAPI looks like using Tegral OpenAPI:

```kotlin title="my_api.openapi.kts"
// Here, we have what we would put in the 'info' section of our OpenAPI file

title = "My API"
description = "This is my API."
version = "0.0.2"

// Let's describe a simple "Hello World!" endpoint

"/hello" get {
    summary = "A simple endpoint"

    description = "Greets the world."
    200 response {
        description = "The greeting was returned"
        plainText { schema("Hello World!") }
    }
}
```

You can then use the [CLI](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/cli) to convert it to a proper OpenAPI file. The CLI itself has options for JSON, YAML and outputting to a file.

```bash
$ tegral-openapi-cli my_api.openapi.kts -f yaml -o output.yaml
[i] openapi.dump         - Compiling script...
[i] openapi.dump         - Evaluating script...
[!] compiler             - Using new faster version of JAR FS: it should make your build faster, but the new implementation is experimental
[i] openapi.dump         - Output written to /tmp/cli_demo/output.yaml
$ bat output.yaml
───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       │ File: output.yaml
───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1   │ openapi: 3.0.1
   2   │ info:
   3   │   title: My API
   4   │   description: This is my API.
   5   │   version: 0.0.2
   6   │ paths:
   7   │   /hello:
   8   │     get:
   9   │       summary: A simple endpoint
  10   │       description: Greets the world.
  11   │       responses:
  12   │         "200":
  13   │           description: The greeting was returned
  14   │           content:
  15   │             text/plain:
  16   │               schema:
  17   │                 type: string
  18   │               example: Hello World!
───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```

:::note

You can use [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) to easily run the Tegral OpenAPI CLI. In this case, your command would be:

```bash
jbang run guru.zoroark.tegral:tegral-openapi-cli:0.0.2
```

:::

This gives us the following output when ran through Swagger UI:

### Integration with Ktor

The new Tegral OpenAPI [Ktor and Ktor UI modules](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/ktor) provide integration between OpenAPI, Swagger UI and Ktor.

#### Describe endpoints and applications

This module allows you to describe your Ktor application and endpoints directly in your code!

Let's implement the API we described above using Ktor:

```kotlin title="Controller.kt"
install(TegralOpenApiKtor) {
    title = "My API"
    description = "This is my API."
    version = "0.0.2"
}

routing {
    get("/hello") {
        call.respondText("Hello World!")
        // highlight-start
    } describe {
        summary = "A simple endpoint"

        description = "Greets the world."
        200 response {
            description = "The greeting was returned"
            plainText { schema("Hello World!") }
        }
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

#### Serve the OpenAPI document

You can serve the OpenAPI document for your application using `openApiEndpoint()` just like you would use a `get` or `post`:

```kotlin
routing {
    openApiEndpoint("/openapi")
}
```

The endpoint has [a few parameters available](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/ktor#describing-endpoints) to control its output.

#### Swagger UI

An additional plugin called [`TegralSwaggerUiKtor`](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/ktor#tegral-openapi-ktorui) allows you to serve Swagger UI from your Ktor application, and bind it onto an OpenAPI endpoint. This can be the endpoint you set up using `openApiEndpoint`, or another endpoint entirely. This plugin does not require you to use `TegralOpenApiKtor`.

Setting up is as simple as:

```kotlin
install(TegralSwaggerUiKtor)

routing {
    swaggerUiEndpoint("/swagger", "/openapi")
}
```

### Tegral Web integration

If you use Tegral Web, you will only need to install the [OpenAPI feature](pathname:///docs/modules/core/openapi/tegral-web), which will:

- Install the OpenAPI and Swagger UI integrations
- Set up `/_t/openapi` for serving your OpenAPI document and `/_t/swagger` for serving Swagger UI.

Just do:

```kotlin
tegral {
    // ...
    install(OpenApiFeature)
    // ...
}
```

## Integration tests

Integration tests were added to Tegral!

Integration tests allow you to easily test the overall behavior of your application. A few scenarios match this:

- Testing interactions between components.
- Testing the behavior of the application as a whole (or with a set of components).

See the [last part of the Step 2 of the tutorial](pathname:///docs/get-started/tutorial/step-2-adding-tests#integration-testing) and the [Tegral Web AppTest](pathname:///docs/modules/web/apptest/) for more information.

Here's an example of an integration test setup:

```kotlin
class GreetingService {
    fun greet(who: String?): String = "Hello World!"
}

class GreetingController(scope: InjectionScope) : KtorController() {
    private val service: GreetingService by scope()

    override fun Routing.install() {
        get("/greet") {
            call.respond(service.greet())
        }
    }
}

val appModule = tegralDiModule {
    put(::GreetingService)
    put(::GreetingController)
}

class ExampleTest : TegralWebIntegrationTest({
    put(appModule)
}) {
    @Test
    fun `greet endpoint test without arguments`() = test {
        val result = client.get("/greet").body<Greeting>()
        assertEquals(Greeting("hello", "world"), result)
    }
}
```

## More flexible injections in Tegral DI

A pretty major (yet fully behind-the-scenes) change occurred in Tegral DI Core this version.

### Background

With version 0.0.1 (and with previous versions of [Shedinja](https://github.com/utybo/Shedinja)), environments used to have a 1-to-1 mapping of identifiers to actual object instances.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph Environment components
    id1[Identifier of A] --> ins1[Instance of A]
    id2[Identifier of B] --> ins2[Instance of B]
end
```

While this covered most simple cases, it was actually rather cumbersome for more advanced ones.

Let's take factories as an example: previously, you would have to do this to retrieve an object generated by a factory (say a logger):

```kotlin
class LogThings(scope: InjectionScope) {
    // highlight-start
    private val logger: Logger by scope.factory()
    // highlight-end
    // ...
}
```

Notice the extra `.factory`? This meant that you had to know in advance if the object you were trying to retrieve was a factory or not.

Even more problematic, some cases could just not be fulfilled. Say you have the following:

```kotlin
interface Contract {
    fun greet()
}

class ContractImpl : Contract {
    override fun greet() {
        println("Hello World!")
    }

    val notExposedThroughContact = "Secrets!"
}

class User(scope: InjectionScope) {
    // highlight-start
    private val contract: Contract by scope()
    // highlight-end

    fun doSomething() {

    }
}
```

Notice how we're referring to the `Contract` interface and not `ContractImpl`.

Now, we could do this previously by doing the following:

```kotlin
tegralDi {
    put<Contract>(::ContractImpl)
    put(::User)
}
```

But that wasn't always the best solution: what if we also want to be able to directly retrieve `ContractImpl`, say by this component:

```kotlin
class GiveMeSecrets(scope: InjectionScope) {
    private val contractImpl: ContractImpl by scope()

    fun doSomething() {
        println("The secret is: " + contractImpl.notExposedThroughContact)
    }
}
```

We would need some "aliasing" system, which would once again lead us to ugly "I-need-to-know-what-this-is-in-advance" situations.

Not anymore!

### The solution

The components contained in an environment were overhauled to now map identifiers to _resolvers_.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph Environment components
    id1[Identifier of A] --> res1[Static resolver]
    id2[Identifier of B] --> res2[Static resolver]
end
res1 --> ins1[Instance of A]
res2 --> ins2[Instance of B]
```

At first, this may seem just like complicating things, but if we now put an alias...

```mermaid
flowchart TD
subgraph Environment components
subgraph Keys
idC[Identifier of Contract]
idCi[Identifier of ContractImpl]
end
subgraph Values
    idC --> resC[Alias resolver] -.-> idCi
    idCi --> resCi[Static resolver]
end
end
resCi --> insCi[Instance of ContractImpl]
```

You can see that the resolver can "go back" in the keys to get the actual resolver it's interested in.

The same goes for factories:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
subgraph Environment components
subgraph Keys
idL[Identifier of Logger]
idFSL["Identifier of FactorySupplier&lt;Logger&gt;"]
end
subgraph Values
    idL --> resF[Factory resolver] -.-> idFSL
    idFSL --> resFSL[Static resolver]
end
end
resFSL --> insCi["Instance of FactorySupplier&lt;Logger&gt;"]
insCi -->|New Logger instance| resF
```

As for our previous "alias" example, it can now work as-is using the following declarations:

```kotlin
tegralDi {
    put(::ContractImpl)
    putAlias<Contract, ContractImpl>()
    put(::User)
    put(::GiveMeSecrets)
}
```

### TL;DR

- You no longer need to put `by scope.factory()` to retrieve factories: you can just use `by scope()` instead.
- You can now add [aliases](pathname:///docs/modules/core/di/aliases) with `putAlias` and retrieve them using `by scope()`
- All of this is powered by a new "resolution" system for maximum flexibility. Hurray!

You can learn more about all of this in the new ["DI Internals" documentation page](pathname:///docs/modules/core/di/internals).

## Logging improvements

A few improvements were made to logging in Tegral Web applications.

### Configuration

You can now configure logging levels for the various loggers directly in your `tegral.toml` file:

```toml
[tegral.logging]
# Default root logging level
level = "Debug"

[tegral.logging.loggers."my.logger"]
# Logging level for the "my.logger" logger
level = "Warn"
```

### Logging defaults

Logs will look a bit nicer by default in your Tegral Web applications (with colors for the logger and log level). Yay!

## Miscellaneous highlights

_For a full list of changes, please refer to our [changelog](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/tree/main/CHANGELOG.md)._

- Tegral DI: `UnsafeMutableEnvironment`, which is the environment you use when testing Tegral DI-powered components, is now extensible. This allows you to install Tegral DI extensions in tests.

- Tegral Featureful: `LifecycleHookedFeature` features have appeared, which allow for more precise hooking into specific lifecycle events. These are mostly used by internal features, but can also be useful for external features.

- Tegral Web Controllers: `KtorApplication`'s `setup` function was removed, as it broke a few design patterns and ended up becoming a problem when developing integration tests. If you were directly implementing your own `KtorApplication`, you will need to move code that was in `setup` to a high-priority `KtorModule` instead.

- Tegral Web AppDefaults: All services will be cleanly stopped when the application is shut down (via Ctrl+C-ing for example).

- A few versions were bumped along the way, including Ktor, Kotlin, Gradle and Hoplite.

## Plans for the future

Unfortunately, as the summer will come to an end, so will the time I can fully dedicate to Tegral. For now, my focus will be on adding small features everywhere and adding more documentation as necessary.

Some more long-term goals are still database integration (with Exposed, and some Flyway-like tool).

## Final words

Thanks for your interest in Tegral! This has been a fun side project of mine, and I'm excited to see people try out some of the brand new features! Feel free to ask questions and report bugs via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral), I'm all ears!

Finally, I'd like to thank [sksamuel](https://github.com/sksamuel) for the extremely fast response to merging (and releasing!) the two PRs I made on [Hoplite](https://github.com/sksamuel/hoplite). Hoplite is the library used by Tegral Config to parse configuration files, and I encountered a few bugs along the way, which I fixed and submitted PRs for. I was a bit worried about not getting a release before a few months, but sksamuel ended up merging and releasing them extremely quickly. Thank you very much![^1]

I'd also like to thank [ALP011216](https://github.com/ALP011216) for the [initial migration](https://github.com/utybo/Koa/pull/7) of what would become Tegral OpenAPI to Ktor 2!

[^1]: I've also just found out `sksamuel` is the same dev behind the very impressive [Kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest). What can't he do? :)

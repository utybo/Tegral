## [Unreleased] (0.0.5)

### Added

- `tegral-featureful`

  - Features can now be configured in-code. You can now configure specific aspects of a feature directly in code, without the need of always using a configuration file. ([#87](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/87))

- `tegral-web-controllers`

  - **Experimental** Controllers and modules can now be declared using fundefs. ([#87](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/87))

- `tegral-di-core`

  - **Experimental** Fundefs whose function is annotated with `@Fundef` can now be `put()` like any other component, e.g. `put(::myFundef)` ([#87](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/87))

  - Factories now support qualifiers. Add the qualifier to the `putFactory` call and use it when requesting a factory like with a regular component. ([#91](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/91))

- `tegral-prismakt-generator`

  - A "shadow" JAR is now published in addition to the regular JAR. Recommendations for integrating PrismaKT Generator into Gradle projects have been updated to use this shadow JAR. ([#90](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/90))

### Changed

- `tegral-web-appdsl`

  - Variations of `useConfiguration` renamed to avoid shadowing: ([#90](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/90))
    - **BREAKING CHANGE**
    - `useConfiguration<T>` -> `useConfigurationType<T>`
    - `useConfiguration(T::class)` -> `useConfigurationClass(T::class)`

- Dependency updates ([#90](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/90))

### Removed

- `tegral-openapi-dsl`

  - `Builder<T>` has been removed. Replace all remaining uses with Tegral Core's `Buildable<T>`.

## [0.0.4] - 2023-05-14

### Added

- `tegral-niwen` (`tegral-niwen-parser` and `tegral-niwen-lexer`)

  - **Experimental** Initial release

- `tegral-prismakt`

  - **Experimental** Initial release

- `tegral-di-core`

  - **Experimental** Added functional component definitions (fundefs).

- `tegral-openapi-dsl`

  - You can now define operation things (such as parameters, responses, etc.) at the *path* level. This allows you to define common properties between all of the operations within the same path.

  - Added the ability to add headers to API responses.

- `tegral-openapi-ktor`

  - You can now describe operations using an OperationBuilder, in addition to the existing direct DSL-way. This is mostly an internal change that was made to support the new Ktor Resources functionality.

- `tegral-openapi-ktor-resources`

  - Resources descriptions now have proper support for:

    - *Parent* resources. Descriptions of parent resources will now cascade down to their children. This is comparable to an automatic `describeSubroutes`.

    - Multiple operations on the same resource. You can now use `get`, `post`, etc. in the description of a resource. Anything set outside of these blocks will be applied to all following operations, while anything set inside will be applied to that specific operation.

- `tegral-web-config`

  - Web configuration was made optional: it is no longer mandatory to have a configuration file. If no configuration file is found, a default configuration will be loaded instead.

### Changed

- `tegral-config-core`

  - Sectioned configurations can now be completely absent. If all of the registered sections are optional, this will lead to a default configuration being created.

- `tegral-openapi-ktor`

  - Misc. internal changes:

    - `getOpenApiOrNullWithMessage` is now public

    - The DSL context in the `TegralOpenApiKtor` plugin is now publicly accessible via the `context` property.

    - `getHooksForRoute` now returns a list instead of a sequence.

## [0.0.3] - 2022-10-01

### Added

- General

  - All packages can now be used with Java 11
    ([#45](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/45))

- `tegral-openapi-ktor-resources`

  - Initial release ([#43](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/43))

    - Provides a way of describing
      [Ktor resource classes](https://ktor.io/docs/type-safe-routing.html#resource_classes).

    - Contributed by [@serras](https://github.com/serras), thank you!

### Deprecated

- `tegral-di-core`

  - Deprecate the old `scope.factory()` syntax. Use `scope()` directly instead.
    ([#52](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/52))

### Fixed

- `tegral-openapi-core`

  - Fixed the way media type examples are handled (specifically,
    properly handle cases where it is null vs when it is unset).
    ([#41](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/41))

- `tegral-web-appdsl`

  - Properly expose both `RootConfig` and the custom configuration class (if
    any) ([#41](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/49))

## [0.0.2] - 2022-08-14

### Added

- `tegral-core`

  - Added `tegralVersion` property that provides the current version of
    Tegral ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

- `tegral-di-core`

  - Added an identifier resolution system to injection environments. This
    unlocks more advanced use-cases, such as proper factories without
    `scope.factory()` or aliasing.
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Added `putAlias` and aliases.
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Added an `EnvironmentComponents` type alias.
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Added `filterSubclassesOf` function, which is especially useful for
    writing extensions. ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

    - `filterSubclassesOf` also properly works with Proxies (e.g. MockK mocks)
      ([#29](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/29))

- `tegral-di-test`

  - `UnsafeMutableEnvironment` is now an extensible environment.
    ([#16](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/16))

  - Added `entryOf` utility function.
    ([#16](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/16))

  - Utility classes for testing environments' behavior (`EnvironmentBaseTest`,
    `ExtensibleEnvironmentBaseTest` and `NotExtensibleEnvironmentBaseTest`).
    ([#16](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/16))

- `tegral-featureful`

  - Added `LifecycleHookedFeature`, which allows you to create features
    that listen to specific "hooks" outside of the regular start-stop
    cycle. This should be used carefully and are mostly intended for
    "low-level" operations.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

- `tegral-logging`

  - Added logging configuration. You can now configure loggers directly
    in your `tegral.toml` -- Logback will be configured accordingly.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

  - Added a `putLoggerFactory` function to easily add factories to any
    environment, especially ones that do not have features support.
    ([#29](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/29))

- `tegral-openapi-cli`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Provides a command line interface for converting `*.openapi.kts`
      scripts into OpenAPI JSON and YAML files.

- `tegral-openapi-dsl`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Provides a Kotlin DSL for writing OpenAPI documents

- `tegral-openapi-feature`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Tegral feature that integrates the Ktor plugins into Tegral Web applications

- `tegral-openapi-ktor`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Ktor plugin for describing endpoints and serving OpenAPI documents
      from a Ktor application.

- `tegral-openapi-ktorui`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Ktor plugin that serves Swagger UI from a Ktor application.

- `tegral-openapi-scriptdef`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Kotlin scripting definitions for `*.openapi.kts` scripts.

- `tegral-openapi-scripthost`

  - Initial release ([#32](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/32))

    - Allows you to evaluate `*.openapi.kts` scripts.

- `tegral-web-appdefaults`

  - Added `ObjectMapper.defaultTegralConfiguration()` function, which lets you
    apply Tegral's defaults to your own object mappers.
    ([#17](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/17))

  - Added an automatic default configuration for logging. This creates a
    better logging experience out of the box than the Logback defaults.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

  - Tegral will now stop all services when receiving a shutdown hook from the
    JVM (done via the `ShutdownHookService`).
    ([#29](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/29))

- `tegral-web-appdsl`

  - Added `TegralApplication.stop()` ([#19](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/19))

  - Added bindings for the new automatic default configuration for
    logging. You can disable this custom logging by passing an argument
    in the `tegral` function.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

  - Added the ability to disable AppDefaults. Passing
    `enableDefaults = false` to the `tegral` will not call AppDefaults'
    `applyDefaults()` function and will not install the various default
    features and configurations.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

  - The `tegral` block will now print more useful information as well as
    statistics on startup.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

  - Added `features` and `lifecycleFeatures` extension properties to
    `TegralAPplication`
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

  - Added calls to the lifecycle hooked features where relevant
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

- `tegral-web-apptest`

  - Initial release. ([#17](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/17))

- `tegral-web-controllers-test`

  - `client` instances will probably be configured to work out of the box
    against AppDefaults powered applications. For now, this means that JSON
    content will work out of the box.
    ([#17](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/17))

  - Added `DEFAULT_APP_SETUP_MODULE_PRIORITY` constant.
    ([#17](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/17))

- `tegral-web-greeter`

  - Initial release ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

    - Adds a simple greeting message when launching applications.

### Changed

- General

  - Bumped Ktor version to version 2.0.3
    ([#17](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/17))

  - Bumped Kotlin version to 1.7.10
    ([#27](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/27))

  - Bumped Gradle version to 7.5
    ([#27](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/27))

  - Bumped Hoplite version to 2.3.3
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

- `tegral-di-core`

  - **Breaking change:** You no longer need to write `scope.factory()` to
    retrieve elements generated by a factory. You can just use `scope()`
    instead. ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Regular, non-extensible injection environments are now also required
    to implement a `getAllIdentifiers` function.
    ([#10](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/10))

    - `EagerImmutableMetaEnvironment` has been updated to implement this.

  - Declarations now come in two kinds: supplier declarations (with `put`) and
    resolvable declarations (for special declarations that will be turned into a
    non-simple injection resolver, such as aliases or factories).
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Factories now use resolvable identifiers instead of a wrapper with `wrapIn`.
    This means that they now respect the early or lazy injection system from the
    environment. ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Built-in environments and checks have been updated to fully support
    resolving ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23)).

    - `EagerImmutableMetaEnvironment` now uses a two-step build, with a first
      step instantiating resolvers, and a second step actually resolving
      everything.

  - `tegralDi` now takes an additional, optional `metaEnvironmentKind` parameter
    when creating extensible environments.
    ([#16](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/16))

  - `InjectionEnvironmentKind<E>` interface is now a functional interface.
    ([#16](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/16))

  - `createMetaEnvironment` function now returns the correct type of
    `InjectionEnvironment`, determined via the generic parameter of
    `InjectionEnvironmentKind` ([#16](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/16))

- `tegral-di-test`

  - Adapted `UnsafeMutableEnvironment` for the new resolution mechanism.
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - Adapted checks for the new resolution mechanism.
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))
    - As a rule of thumb, in all "graph-like" representations on check failures,
      `-->` arrows represent a regular injection dependency, while `R->`
      represents resolution-time dependencies.
    - `complete` will report missing resolution-time dependencies.
    - `noCycle` will report cyclic dependencies, no matter whether they are
      caused by regular injections or resolution-time dependencies.
    - `noUnused` will consider resolution-time dependencies as used.
    - Safe injection check will ignore resolution-time dependencies.
    - `DependencyTrackingInjectionEnvironment` has been updated to provide
      insights on dependencies.

  - Added more tests in `(Extensible)EnvironmentBaseTest` for new
    resolution behaviors, including aliases and proper parent
    resolution. ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

- `tegral-web-appdefaults`

  - Split declaration of default Ktor configuration into a separate Ktor module.
    This means that AppDefaults no longer does anything in its `setup` function.
    This was done for compatibility with integration testing.
    ([#17](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/17)))

- `tegral-web-appdsl`

  - `TegralApplication.start()` is now a suspending function.
    ([#19](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/19))

- `tegral-web-controllers`

  - Made some `KtorApplicationSettings` properties public: `engine`, `port`,
    `host`, `watchPaths` ([#19](https://github/utybo/Tegral/pull/19))

### Removed

- `tegral-web-controllers`

  - **Breaking change:** `KtorApplication.setup()` has been removed due to
    incompatibility with integration testing. Use a regular module instead,
    making it high-priority if necessary.
    ([#36](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/36))

### Fixed

- `tegral-di-services`

  - The services extension now properly detects services where the "advertised"
    type is not a `TegralService`, but the type of the actual object is. For
    example, if you have a `put<Contract>(::Implementation)` declaration, the
    services extension will properly detect services even if only
    `Implementation` implements `TegralService`.
    ([#23](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/23))

  - The services extension now properly detects services that are actually
    mocks. ([#29](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/29))

- `tegral-di-test`

  - Fixed the error message when not using any DI check in a DI block showing
    the old Shedinja way of adding rules.
    ([#29](https://github.com/utybo/Tegral/pull/29))

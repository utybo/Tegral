# Tegral is no longer maintained

I made Tegral as a way to continue making Kotlin project towards the end of my engineering school curriculum. Since I now have a job (that unfortunately does not involve Kotlin), I have lost motivation to continue working on this project, and thus will no longer maintain it. I am mostly done with "Open Source as a hobby", so this will probably be the last you'll see of me around here. Thanks for the ride! 

Feel free to fork and continue working on this project. Previous readme below.

**Tegral** is a collection of reusable Kotlin components, like libraries and frameworks, that can be used by themselves or combined together to create back-ends apps with Tegral Web.

```kotlin
class HelloController : KtorController() {
    override fun Routing.install() {
        get("/") {
            call.respondText("Hello World!")
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    tegral {
        put(::HelloController)
    }
}
```

Each Tegral library is reusable and extensible. Pick the most suitable libraries for your project, or maybe even all of them for a full Tegral-based application.
